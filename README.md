# GraphIntegrator
## Overview
Uses Python (MatPlotLib) to generate graphs from user data inputs. The current usage will include:
- Line graphs (time axis for extended analysis)
- Pie charts (comparative option for percentages)
- Bar charts (another strong comparative option)
- Scatter graphs (comfortable trend analysis option for data)

## Skills used/required
- Python
- MatPlotLib (library for graph plotting and other mathematical functions for Python)
  
## Current To-Do plan:
- Proper implementation of line graphs, pie charts, bar charts, and scatter graphs.
- Application of "Lines of best fit" for scatter graphs, allowing for easier visual analysis of data.
- Integrating horizontal as well as vertical comparisons for data (data can be compared either:
  - On a time scale with previous inputs of the same sorts, or
  - On the same time scale, but with different data, given that the type of data being compared is identical, eg different test grades across a school as opposed to a subject)
