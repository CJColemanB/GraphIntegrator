# GraphIntegrator
Uses Python (MatPlotLib) to generate graphs from user data inputs. The current usage will include:
- Line graphs (time axis for extended analysis)
- Pie charts (comparative option for percentages)
- bar charts (another strong comparative option)

Current To-Do plan includes:
- Integrating horizontal as well as vertical comparisons for data (data can be compared either:
-> on a time scale with previous inputs of the same sorts, or
-> on the same time scale, but with different data, given that the type of data being compared is identical, eg different test grades across a school as opposed to a subject)
